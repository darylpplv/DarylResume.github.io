At age seven, he began dancing which he then considered as a hobby. Later on, Michael Jackson “The King of Pop” made a big impact in him and he started imitating and impersonating him. He pursued more his dancing when Michael Jackson passed away on June 2009 which led him to do dance covers of MJ on YouTube as a tribute. In 2010, he joined his first dance crew in town, the No X’QZ. Well known dancers like Brian Puspos, Ian Eastwood, Keone and Mari, and many more dancers serve as his motivation to share his knowledge and his passion to all the dancers.
